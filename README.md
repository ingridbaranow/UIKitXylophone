# Xylophone

## The Goal

The goal with this project was to dive into a simple iOS recipe: how to play sounds using Apple’s AVFoundation framework. I believe one of the most important skills as a developer is knowing how to solve own problems. For that, I explored StackOverflow, the Apple Documentation, and practiced how to search for solutions effectively. By learning to use these tools, I can now start adding custom features to an app and make it do exactly what I want.


## What I created

I built my first musical instrument app! I created a colorful Xylophone app—yep, the XyloPhone! (Okay, the joke’s a bit cheesy, but I had to include it!)

## What I learned

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Understand Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
* Functions and methods in Swift. 
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
